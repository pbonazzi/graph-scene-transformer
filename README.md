# 3D Scene Generation with Scene Graphs Leveraging Self-Attention

This repository contains code for master project of Pietro Bonazzi and Mengqi Wang. Supervised by Diego Martin Arroyo (Google), Fabian Manhardt (Google) and Nico Messikommer (UZH Robotics & Perceptions Group). 
 
We present a conditional VAE architecture with self-attention layers as fundamental building blocks, tailored to 3D scene generation from scene graphs.

## Setup

[Follow these instructions](./docs/installation.md) to set up the virtual environment.

## Data
Download the <a href="https://shapenet.org/download/shapenetsem" >ShapeNetSem</a> dataset to the `input/data/shapenet_sem` folder

## Training
To train our main model (GPH) run:
```
CONFIG_PATH=config/1_GPH.json
SHAPENET_PATH="input/data/shapenet_sem"
python3 main.py --c $CONFIG_PATH --sp $SHAPENET_PATH
```

## Evaluation
To inference on scene graphs and floor plans, change the `inference` parameter in config file to be `True` and run same codes above.
